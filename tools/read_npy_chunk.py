def read_npy_chunk(filename, start_row, num_rows):
    """
    Reads a partial array (contiguous chunk along the first
    axis) from an NPY file.
    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Name/path of the file from which to read.
    start_row : int
        The first row of the chunk you wish to read. Must be
        less than the number of rows (elements along the first
        axis) in the file.
    num_rows : int
        The number of rows you wish to read. The total of
        `start_row + num_rows` must be less than the number of
        rows (elements along the first axis) in the file.
    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array with `out.shape[0] == num_rows`, equivalent to
        `arr[start_row:start_row + num_rows]` if `arr` were
        the entire array (note that the entire array is never
        loaded into memory by this function).
